# CharityWork
GOAL: Need to help others find work,
I have limited knowledge in coding, my last coding was 20yrs back. 
I am on a mission to learn something new about Windows APPS and to create a website and/or mobile app that can help folks find voluntary work (job search + posting)
Not sure where to start but I am sure I will get there somehow with some help.
Today is day 1 of my journey!!! 28/04/2016
